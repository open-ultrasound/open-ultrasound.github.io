We got our open source ultrasound electronics working for the first time today.  It's very exciting!

Below is our current hardware setup.  The ultrasound front-end is the part that we designed and built.  We purchased everything else.

We put the purchased sensor head into a cup of water.

And we got our first image!  We clearly see the reflection off the bottom of the cup.
