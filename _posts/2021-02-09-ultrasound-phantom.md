Ultrasound phantoms are as close to the "gold standard" for evaluating imaging system performance as there is.  Our collaborators at the [UIUC Bioacoustics Research Lab](https://www.brl.uiuc.edu/) sent us one of their ATS539 phantoms.  Here's a photograph of our test setup.

Our prototype system is limited to 16 channels (while our imaging probe has 128 elements). 


Below are some sample results covering a wide range of pulse center frequencies, durations, and shapes. We have very good command over the excitation and the output waveform below the transducer's center frequency (5-6 MHz). Above that, the impulse response of the transducer begins to dominate. This is not unexpected.
