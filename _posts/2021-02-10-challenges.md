As hinted at in our last blog post, there are a number of limitations with our first generation Open Image system. Given that we built an ultrasound machine from the ground up, this is not surprising. Here's our honest assessment of the current state of the system:

-It works! Let's not forget this. It transmits high-voltage excitation pulses then conditions and digitizes the low-level analog echoes. The raw data can be beamformed and beamformed lines can be stacked to form human-readable images. 
-It only has 16 channels. In order to image most anything worth imaging the probe must be scanned.
