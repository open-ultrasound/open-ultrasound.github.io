One of the benefits of the Open Image platform is the ability to fully customize your transmit waveforms. Our [pulser](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20005639A.pdf) allows for five different amplitude settings (-V_2, -V_1, 0, +V_1, +V_2, where, for our system, V_2 = 80 V and V_1 = 40 V) sampled at 220 MHz.

We measured the transmitted ultrasound pulses (from an Ultrasonix L14-5/38 transducer couple to the Open Image prototype) in water using a [Precision Acoustics Needle Hydrophone](https://www.acoustics.co.uk/product-category/pressure-measurement/needle-hydrophones/):

Below are some sample results covering a wide range of pulse center frequencies, durations, and shapes:
